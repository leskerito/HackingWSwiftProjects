#The Hangman

##Objective

The goal of The Hangman is for one player (the Guesser) to correctly guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, before a certain number of incorrect guesses are made.

##Correct Guess

    If the guessed letter is in the word, we fill in the blanks with the correct letter in the correct positions.
    The guesser can continue guessing letters.

##Incorrect Guess

    If the guessed letter is not in the word, The Hangman actually dims out the Center Image and reduces the music. We wanted this experience to be relaxing instead of violent as usual.

##Winning

    The Guesser wins if they successfully guess all the letters in the word before the image is fully dimmed.

##Losing

    The guesser loses if the image is completely dimmed out.
